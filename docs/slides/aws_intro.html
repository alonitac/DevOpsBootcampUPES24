### About this course

- In-depth knowledge about the core services: AZs, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Amazon EC2 servers, ELB, AWS Auto Scaling, storage, networking, databases, AWS IAM, and security.
- For the other services: what that service does, what the common use cases are for that service.

### The bad old days

- Purchase your own infrastructure (weeks to months to be global)
- Army of IT employees
- Dealing with cooling, hardware failure, disaster recovery
- Dealing with physical security
- Dealing with real estate
- Hidden costs (how many servers should I purchase?)

### Overview of Cloud Computing

- [Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a highly reliable, scalable, and low-cost infrastructure platform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/aws-overview.pdf?did=wp_card&trk=wp_card)
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model
- No need to make large up-front investments in hardware and spend a lot of time managing that hardware
- More than 200 services

### Overview of Cloud Computing

While each organization experiences a unique journey to the cloud with numerous benefits, six advantages become apparent time and time again

### Global Infrastructure

- AWS provides a highly available technology infrastructure platform with multiple locations worldwide.
- These locations are composed of **Regions** and **Availability Zones**.
- Each region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones.
- Each AZ is also isolated, but the AZs in a region are:
  - Physically separated within a typical metropolitan region
  - Located in lower-risk flood plains
  - Connected through low-latency links
  - On-site backup generators
  - Fed via different grids from independent utilities (when available)
- By placing resources in separate AZ, your service is protected from a disruption impacting a single location

### AWS the Shared Responsibility Model

- Cloud security at AWS is the number one priority.
- Built-in security architecture for visibility, auditability, controllability, and agility.
- AWS are responsible for the security **of** the cloud, while allow to secure anything you deploy **in** the cloud. This called the [Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/).

### Compliance

- Organizations retain complete control and ownership over the region in which their data is physically located, allowing them to meet regional compliance and data residency requirements.

# Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2)

![](https://exit-zero-academy.github.io/DevOpsTheHardWayAssets/slides/media/aws_ec2_logo.png)

</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  ><textarea data-template>


### Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) overview


- Reliable, secure, and almost infinite compute capability
- Preconfigured templates for your instances, known as Amazon Machine Images (**AMI**s), that package the bits you need for your server (Linux and Windows)
- Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for your instances, known as **instance types**
- Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), known as **Amazon EBS** volumes
- A firewall that enables you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances using **security groups**
- Natively integrated with most of the AWS services
- Pay-as-you-go [pricing model](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/)

</textarea></section>
<section data-markdown  data-auto-animate><textarea data-template>

### Amazon Machine Images (AMI)

An [Amazon Machine Image (AMI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html) is a supported and maintained image provided by AWS that provides the information required to launch an instance.

- Most common Linux and Windows distro images ready to use
- You can launch an instance from an existing AMI, customize the instance (for example, install software on the instance), and then save this updated configuration as a custom AMI.
- You can purchase AMIs from a third party, including AMIs that come with service contracts from organizations such as Red Hat.

<section data-markdown  data-auto-animate><textarea data-template>

### Instance types

When you launch an instance, the [instance type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html) that you specify determines the hardware of the host computer used for your instance.


- Each instance type offers different compute, memory, and storage capabilities.
- Instances are grouped in an instance family based on these capabilities.
- Remember that your EC2 shares other resources of the host computer, with other AWS customers. If each instance on a host computer tries to use as much of one of these shared resources as possible, each receives an equal share of that resource.
- If the host computer is underused, your instance can consume a **higher** share of that resource while it's available.
- Amazon Web Services offers [previous generation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#previous-gen-instances) instance types for users who have optimized their applications around them, as well as then [current generation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-types.html#current-gen-instances) types.

### Instance types name

Instance types are named based on their family (**c**), generation (**5**), additional capabilities (**n**), and size (**xlarge**).

- Possible families are: General purpose, Compute optimized, Memory optimized, Storage optimized, Accelerated computing
- The following are the additional capabilities indicated by the instance type names:
  - a – AMD processors
  - i – Intel processors
  - d – Instance store volumes
  - n – Network optimization
  - b – Block storage optimization

### Networking and storage features

When you select an instance type, this determines the networking and storage features that are available.

- IPv6 is supported on all current generation instance types.
- To maximize the networking and bandwidth performance of your instance type, you can do the following:
  - Launch supported instance types into a cluster [placement group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html).
  - Enable [enhanced networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html).
- To obtain additional, dedicated capacity for Amazon EBS I/O, you can launch some instance types as [EBS–optimized instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html).
- The EBS volume persists independently for the life span of the instance. Three types of volumes:
  - General purpose (SSD)
  - Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS)
  - Magnetic

### EC2 Security

- A [key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) is a set of security credentials that you use to prove your identity when connecting to an instance. AWS stores the public key on your instance, and you store the private key.
- A [security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-security-groups.html) acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
- You can specify one or more security groups. If you don't specify a security group, AWS uses the default security group.
- New and modified rules are automatically applied to all instances that are associated with the security group.
- A security group is **default deny** and **stateful**.
