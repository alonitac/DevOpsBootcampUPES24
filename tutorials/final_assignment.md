# The Netflix Stack Bootcamp Assignment

## Overview

Throughout this bootcamp, you've been building and deploying components of the Netflix stack.
Now, it's time to bring everything together into a fully functional system.

## Objectives

- Deploy a containerized microservices architecture in EC2 instances, composed of:
  - **Nginx**: As the HTTP engine and reverse proxy.
  - **NetflixFrontend**: A Node.js web app serving as the frontend.
  - **NetflixMovieCatalog**: A Flask-based API for the movie catalog.
  - **Monitoring Stack**: Grafana and InfluxDB for monitoring, with a bash script to test service availability.
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate deployment of updates to the NetflixFrontend, NetflixMovieCatalog, and Nginx configuration.
- All services accessible via a domain registered and managed through Route 53.

## Submission

- Push your code and configuration files to dedicated GitHub repositories.
- In each repo, create a `README.md` with detailed instructions for using the code.
- Present your deployed system, explaining the architecture and demonstrate the CI/CD process.

# Good Luck
