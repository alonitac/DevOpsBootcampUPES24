# Linux Intro

Linux is a free and open-source operating system based on the Unix operating system. 
It was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds and has since become one of the most widely used operating systems in the world. 

Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility, which makes it a popular choice for servers, embedded systems, and supercomputers. 
In recent years, Linux has gained popularity among desktop users as well, due to its ease of use and the availability of a wide range of free and open-source software applications.

Learning Linux is a very valuable skill for DevOps engineers, as it provides a deep understanding of the operation system upon which many modern applications and services are operating.
In this course we will cover two main core components of every Linux system: files and processes, as well as a lot of small topics such as io redirect, package management, environment variables and useful commands.

## First Steps

### The command line

We'll be learning Linux using the command line (a.k.a. **Terminal**) running shell called **Bash**.
The command line interface (**cli**) may seem confusing and unfriendly for new users. Don't worry, with a bit of practice you'll soon see how useful this tool is.
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. Type any command text in the cli, and an output will be given to you, as text.
The command line typically presents you with a **prompt**. Most of the time you will be issuing commands.

Here is an example:

```console
myuser@hostname:~$ echo Hello world
Hello world
myuser@hostname:~$ ls
file1 file2 file3 somedirectory
```

**Important!** Whenever you see a code snippet, as in the above block, you are expected to execute the command in your terminal and experiment with the results.

Usually, in order to work on a Linux system directly, you will need to login to the system by providing a username and password (don't forget them!). Upon successful login, a standard prompt displays the user's login name, the hostname, and the current working directory.
In the above example, `myuser` will be your login name, `hostname` is the name of the machine you are working on, and `~` (tilde) is an indication of your current location in the file system.

### Shortcuts

Bash is full of helpful shortcuts. You'll be introduced to several of them throughout the course. Here is a table summarizing the most important shortcuts, try them out in your terminal!

| Key or key combination          | Function                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ctrl+A or Home key              | Move cursor to the beginning of the command line.                                                                |
| Ctrl+D                          | Log out of the current shell session, equal to typing the `exit` or `logout` commands                            |
| Ctrl+E or End key               | Move cursor to the end of the command line.                                                                      |
| Ctrl+L                          | Clear this terminal, equivalent to the `clear` command                                                           |
| Ctrl+R                          | Search command history                                                                                           |
| ArrowUp and ArrowDown           | Browse history. Go to the line that you want to repeat, edit details if necessary, and press Enter to save time. |
| Shift+PageUp and Shift+PageDown | Browse terminal buffer                                                                                           |
| Tab                             | Command or filename completion                                                                                   |
| Tab Tab                         | Shows file or command completion possibilities.                                                                  |


### Basic commands

A lot of commands rely on the directory you are currently working on (a.k.a. **Current working directory**).
To make sure that you are in the right location, use the `pwd` (**p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory) command:

```console
myuser@hostname:~$ pwd
/home/myuser
```

`ls` will list the files and directories in the current location:

```console
myuser@hostname:~$ ls
file1 file2 file3 somedirectory
```

But `ls` has many more functionalities... use `--help` to get the usage guidelines:

```console
myuser@hostname:~$ ls --help
The general form usage is:
ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
```

We can learn some important features of linux commands:

- A command behaves differently when you specify an option, usually preceded with a dash (`-`) for short flag or (`--`) for full flag name, as in `ls -a` or `ls --all`.
- Whenever you see `<something>`, it means you need to replace this with something useful. Replace the whole thing (including the `<` and `>`).
- Whenever you see `[something]` this usually means that this something is optional. When you run the command you may put in something or leave it out.
- The argument(s) to a command are specifications for the object(s) on which you want the command to take effect. An example is `ls /etc`, where the directory `/etc` is the argument to the ls command.


## Getting help

Here are a few ways you can seek help and get answers to your questions:

- `<command> --help` - how to run the command, what are the accepted options and arguments.
- `man <command>` - the manual is a set of pages that explain everything on the command, including what it does. In the man page, type `/` to search specific words.
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)

## File system fundamentals

**"On a Linux system, everything is a file; if something is not a file, it is a process."**

In linux, under the hood, everything is actually a **file**. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only), when you want to send data over the internet, you write it to a unique file, etc.
How could that statement be true? because there are **special files** that are more than just files (e.g. sockets, devices etc.).

```console
myuser@hostname:~$ ls -l
total 80
-rw-rw-r--  1 myuser     myuser   31744 Feb 21 17:56 intro Linux.doc
-rw-rw-r--  1 myuser     myuser   41472 Feb 21 17:56 Linux.doc
drwxrwxr-x  2 myuser     myuser   4096  Feb 25 11:50 course
```

In the above output, the first dash (`-`) represents the file type.
We can notice that `course` is a directory, since the first dash is `d`: `drwxrwxr-x`, while `Linux.doc` is a regular file, since it starts with `-`.

Here are a few common types in Linux OS:

| Symbol | Meaning      |
|--------|--------------|
| -      | Regular file |
| d      | Directory    |
| l      | Link         |
| c      | Special file |
| s      | Socket       |
| p      | Named pipe   |
| b      | Block device |

In this course, we will deal with plain files, executable files, directories, links, and a bit of sockets.

Another important feature of the linux file system: filename is Case Sensitive, and files has no extension, use the file command to know the content type:

```console
myuser@hostname:~$ touch file1.png
myuser@hostname:~$ echo "hi" > file1.png
myuser@hostname:~$ ls
file1.png
...
myuser@hostname:~$ file file1.png
file1.png: ASCII text
myuser@hostname:~$ file File1.png
File1: ERROR: cannot open 'File1.png' (No such file or directory)
```

In the above example, we used the `touch` command to create an empty file called `file1.png`, and the text "hi" was written into it (this command uses the `>` operator which will be discussed later on).
Then we use the `file` command to inspect the type of the file.
We can see that even though the file extension is `.png` (which is known for images), linux recognizes the file type as a regular text file, which is the correct type.
In linux OS, file extensions are meaningless.

## User home directory

In Linux, each user has a HOME directory which serves as their default working directory when they log in.
This directory contains the user's personal files and settings, and is typically located at `/home/<username>`,  while `<username>` is the username.
The HOME directory is protected by file permissions to ensure that only the user and authorized system administrators can access it.

Here are a few ways to access to a user's home directory in Linux:

1. Using the tilde (`~`) character. Simply use the command `cd ~` or `cd` to change to your own home directory.
2. Using the absolute path, typically `/home/username`.
3. Using the `$HOME` variable: Linux also has a built-in environment variable called `$HOME`, which contains the path to the current user's home directory. You can use the command `cd $HOME` to change to your own home directory (Variables will be discussed later on).


## File path

The file system under linux has an hierarchical structure.
At the very top of the structure is what's called the `root directory`. It is denoted by a single slash (`/`).
It has subdirectories, they have subdirectories and so on. Files may reside in any of these directories.

A **path** is the reference of a particular file or directory on the system.

There are 2 types of paths we can use, **Absolute** and **Relative**. We can refer to a given file either by its Absolute or Relative path, to our choice.

- Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory, they always begin with a forward slash (`/`).
- Relative paths specify a location in relation to the current working directory.

```console
myuser@hostname:~$ pwd
/home/myuser
myuser@hostname:~$ ls Documents
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
...
myuser@hostname:~$ ls /home/myuser/Documents
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
...
```

The above example shows two different ways to reference the `Documents` dir. The first is relatively the current working directory (which is `~`), the second is using absolute path.

A few notes regarding paths:

- `~` (tilde) - is a shortcut for your home dir. e.g. if your home directory is `/home/myuser` then you could refer to the directory Documents with the path `/home/myuser/Documents` or `~/Documents`.
- `.` (dot) - is a reference to your current working directory. e.g. in the example above we could also refer to Documents by `./Documents`.
- `..` (dotdot)- is a reference to the parent directory.

Let's see it in action:

```console
myuser@hostname:~$ pwd
/home/myuser
myuser@hostname:~$ ls ~/Documents
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
...
myuser@hostname:~$ ls ./Documents
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
...
myuser@hostname:~$ ls /home/myuser/Documents
file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
...
myuser@hostname:~$ ls ../../
bin boot dev etc home lib var
...
myuser@hostname:~$ ls /
bin boot dev etc home lib var
...
```

## Important directories

here is a short list of important files and directories in Linux that users should be familiar with:

| Directory | Meaning                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/bin`    | Common programs, shared by the system, the system administrator and the users.                                                                             |
| `/dev`    | Contains references to all the CPU peripheral hardware, which are represented as files with special properties.                                            |
| `/etc`    | Most important system configuration files are in `/etc`, this directory contains data similar to those in the Control Panel in Windows                     |
| `/home`   | Home directories of the common users.                                                                                                                      |
| `/lib`    | Library files, includes files for all kinds of programs needed by the system and the users.                                                                |
| `/proc`   | A virtual file system containing information about system resources.                                                                                       |
| `/root`   | The administrative user's home directory. Mind the difference between `/`, the root directory and `/root`, the home directory of the _root_ user.          |
| `/tmp`    | Temporary space for use by the system, cleaned upon reboot.                                                                                                |
| `/usr`    | Programs, libraries, documentation etc. for all user-related programs.                                                                                     |
| `/var`    | Storage for all variable files and temporary files created by users, such as log files, space for temporary storage of files downloaded from the Internet. |


## Block devices and standards streams

Let's take a closer look on the `/dev` directory:

```console
myuser@hostname:~$ ls -l /dev
brw-rw----  1 root disk    	8,   0 Apr  1 18:30 sda
brw-rw----  1 root disk    	8,   1 Apr  1 18:30 sda1
brw-rw----  1 root disk    	8,   2 Apr  1 18:30 sda2
…
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root     	15 Apr  1 18:29 stderr -> /proc/self/fd/2
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root      	15 Apr  1 18:29 stdin -> /proc/self/fd/0
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root       	15 Apr  1 18:29 stdout -> /proc/self/fd/1
```

We will discuss some important files - block devices.

Note the files `sda`, `sda1`, `sda2`. Those are block device file type (the first dash is `b`).

Device files do not contain data in the same way that regular files, or even directories. Instead, the job of a device node is to act as an interface to a particular device driver within the kernel.

When a user writes to a device node, the device node transfers the information to the appropriate device driver in the kernel. When a user would like to collect information from a particular device, they read from that device's associated device node, just as reading from a file.

Block devices are devices that read and write information a chunk ("block") at a time. Block devices customarily allow random access, meaning that a block of data could be read from anywhere on the device, in any order.

In Linux, "sda," "sda1," and "sda2" are devices that refer to different **partitions** of a storage device, such as a hard drive or SSD.

The "sda" device refers to the entire storage device, while "sda1" and "sda2" are partitions of that device.

- "sda1" is the first partition on the "sda" device
- "sda2" is the second partition on the "sda" device
- etc...

```console
myuser@hostname:~$ lsblk
sda                   	8:0	0 465.8G  0 disk  
├─sda1                	8:1	0   487M  0 part  /boot
└─sda2                	8:5	0 465.3G  0 part
```

We will now discuss other important files: `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`.

Those are the standard input/output streams that are used by programs to read input (from your keyboard) and write output (to your screen).

Here's what each stream does:

1. **Standard Input (stdin)**: This is the stream that carries input to a program. By default, it is associated with the keyboard, so when a user types something into the terminal, it is sent to the program via the standard input file.
2. **Standard Output (stdout)**: This is the stream that carries normal output from a program. By default, it is associated with the terminal, so when a program prints something to the console, it is sent to the standard output file.
3. **Standard Error (stderr)**: This is the stream that carries error messages and other diagnostic output from a program. By default, it is also associated with the terminal, so when a program encounters an error or warning, it prints a message to standard error.

By default, these streams are connected to the terminal, but they can be redirected to files or other streams as well. This is a powerful feature of the Unix shell that allows programs to be combined and orchestrated in powerful ways.

Do you see how **"On a Linux system, everything is a file"**. Keep in mind this statement, it'll help you to understand linux's behavior.
